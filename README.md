# 🗳️ myVoice API

**Civic participation, structured.**  
A backend platform where citizens can submit issues, vote on proposals, and engage in democratic dialogue — built with FastAPI + PostgreSQL.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- **Submit civic issues:** Users can raise local or national concerns
- **Vote on proposals:** Upvote or downvote ideas based on community interest
- **Comment system:** Users can discuss and refine proposals
- **Admin tools:** Moderation and approval layers for transparency (planned)

## 🎯 Why I Built It

Democratic feedback systems are often noisy, disorganized, and inaccessible.  
I wanted to create a clear, structured API-first platform for civic engagement — where real issues can rise through community voice, not chaos.

This is part of a broader goal to build tech for public good.
